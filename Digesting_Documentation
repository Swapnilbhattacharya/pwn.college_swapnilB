## Learning from documentation
This challenge teaches us how to properly read the documentation and to figure out how to use various programs
### My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QIkK7AusHQNLy1mZoPckHCto-v2.QX0ITO0wiM5gjNzEzW}`
I was given a program called challenge in the challenge directory and i was supposed to pass it a specific argument called "--giveflag". 
So I simply used the common documentation style to pass the argument and found the flag
```bash
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{QIkK7AusHQNLy1mZoPckHCto-v2.QX0ITO0wiM5gjNzEzW}
```
### What I learned
I learnt the proper documentation and passed an argument into a given program.

## Learning complex usage
This challenge introduces us to a slightly complicated form of the documentation where we have 2 arguments. 
### My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{AKA7nRHBE52bvT2fASk1ul1bFcd.QX1ITO0wiM5gjNzEzW}`
It was asked that we have to use the --printfile argument on the challenge program in the /challenge directory. 
The argument of the --printfile argument would be my path to the flag which is obviously /flag
Following the documentation I wrote the command and found the flag.
```bash
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:~$ /challenge/challenge --printfile /flag
Correct argument! Here is the /flag file:
pwn.college{AKA7nRHBE52bvT2fASk1ul1bFcd.QX1ITO0wiM5gjNzEzW}
```
### What I learned 
I learned to use little complex commands and used two arguments on a program to find out my flag file.

## Reading Manuals
This introduces us to manuals for various commands that we pass as arguements to the man command(if available)

### My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Q--MnWZ3d_xDjYGV3Yj31x_-J2n.QX0EDO0wiM5gjNzEzW}`
I have been given the program called challenge anf I have to use the proper argument with it to print my flag. On reading the manual i found an argument
called "--ndxjjx NUM" and it was written that the flag will be printed if NUM=333. So i used the very same command but replaced NUM with 333 and my flag got printed.
```bash
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --ndxjjx 333
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{Q--MnWZ3d_xDjYGV3Yj31x_-J2n.QX0EDO0wiM5gjNzEzW}
```
### What I learnt
I learnt to read manuals of the commands and also infer data from it. I used a proper argument mentioned in the manual's description part, 
wrote the proper documentation and got my flag printed.
